LookupsCLI is a tool to run ip lookups

Using a sample of 50 since the endpoint only allows a certain amount of request, but feel free to run the 5000
To run the app you just run the following commands:

```bash
python main.py -g     # Performs a RDAP lookup on the list_of_ips
python main.py -r     # Performs a Geo IP lookup on the list_of_ips  
```
